# PLC-Controlled Liquid Mixing Tank System

## Overview
This project implements an automated liquid mixing system in industrial tanks using Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC). The system aims to replace manual mixing processes with an efficient, accurate, and automated solution.

## Problem Statement
In today's rapidly evolving industrial landscape, manual mixing operations present significant challenges:
- Time-consuming processes
- Inconsistent results
- Resource-intensive supervision requirements

Our PLC-based mixing tank system addresses these challenges by providing an automated, precise, and efficient solution for industrial mixing operations.

## Technology
The system is built using Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), which are advanced industrial control systems that are replacing traditional hard-wired logic relays. PLCs can be programmed using various methods:
- Ladder Diagram
- Structured Text
- Function Block
